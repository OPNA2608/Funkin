!!!! PLEASE READ THIS
!!!! Failure to do so may reduce your chances of getting help with your problem. You've been warned.

1. For your own and everyone else's sake, *please* use the template provided below. Not doing so means:

   - Nobody will know what game version / operating system you're talking about - sometimes a bug may already be fixed in a newer version.
   - Nobody will know if it's our fault, your fault, your system's fault or someone else's fault.
   - Everyone will have to comment with follow-up questions regarding these details.
   - You will have to answer these questions via everyone's follow-up questions anyway.
   - With so many unknown details, nobody might want to try and help you.

2. Please check if anyone else has already filed the same or a similar issue and comment there instead of opening a new one. Someone might've already provided a fix, saving you (and us) time and effort.

3. If your problem is with a browser version, please perform some simple troubleshooting steps before submitting an issue:

   - Clearing your cookies
   - Clearing AppData
   - If in doubt, try another browser

If your unique problem still persists, continue with filling out the following template.
(Everything enclosed in < & > symbols is a comment with suggestions/hints on what to fill in. Comments will not be visible to anyone else once you submit your issue.)

##### What is your bug?
<!--
- Describe the problem you're facing.
- If you've identified any steps to reproduce the bug, explain them.
- If you think images or videos would help, attach/link them.

(Fictitious) example:

Trying to play Tutorial on Easy difficulty instead loads Dadbattle on Hard difficulty. I can reproduce this on both the Itch.io web version and the 64-bit Windows build. It does not occur on the 32-bit Windows build.
