!!!! PLEASE READ THIS
!!!! Failure to do so may reduce your chances of getting feedback to your suggestion. You've been warned.

1. For your own and everyone else's sake, *please* use the template provided below. Not doing so means:

   - Nobody will know what game version / operating system you're talking about - sometimes a feature may already be implemented in a newer version.
   - Everyone will have to comment with follow-up questions regarding these details.
   - You will have to answer these questions via everyone's follow-up questions anyway.

2. Please check if anyone else has already filed the same or a similar suggestion and comment there instead of opening a new one. Someone might've already provided a better version of your idea, or you have some ideas of your own that would improve the feature they're suggesting.

If your unique suggestion still persists, continue with filling out the following template.
(Everything enclosed in < & > symbols is a comment with suggestions/hints on what to fill in. Comments will not be visible to anyone else once you submit your enhancement suggestion.)

##### What version of the game are you playing?
<!--
- What version does the game display in the bottom-left corner of the main menu?
- If the game is incapable of entering the main menu / displaying the version, write "Don't know"

If you're a developer / advanced user:
- If you didn't use a release tag, what commit did you (attempt to) compile the game from?

Examples:
- Version: v0.2.7.1
- Version: v0.2.8(Newgrounds exclusive preview)
- Version: faaf064e37d5a150d8aba451d740eeb81bd2e974
-->

Version: 

##### Where are you playing the game?
<!--
- Newgrounds (https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371): Write "Newgrounds".
- Itch.io (https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin, the web version and NOT a download!): Write "Itch.io".
- Some other website: Please provide a link to the website.
- browserless (downloaded, manually built): Write "Native"

If you're using a browser build, give details about what browser you're trying to use.

Always provide details about your operating system as well!

Examples:
- Platform: Newgrounds, Chrome, Chromebook
- Platform: Itch.io, Safari, macOS 11.0, 2020 MacBook Air

##### What is your suggestion, and why should it be implemented?
<!--
- Describe your idea and why it should be added.
- If you think images or videos would help, attach/link them.

(Fictitious) example:

I think the combo counter should start counting from 2.
Counting from 2 is more intuitive to me, so I think this would be a useful addition.
This could be implemented as a setting in the options menu.
